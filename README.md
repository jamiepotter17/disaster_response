# Disaster Response Project

This is a project for Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree
It was commenced on 2012-02-02. The brief was to:

1. Create an ETL pipeline to prepare data curated by Figure Eight Technologies,
a now defunct analytics firm, and load into an SQLite database. These data are
the raw data of messages sent during natural disasters.
2. Develop a machine learning pipeline that categories the data for better
disaster response efforts, and exports the final model as a pickle file.
3. Produce data visualisations using a Flask web app and Plotly.
